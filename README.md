# Battleship game

Battleship game is a very simple and easy game to play. You have to guess ship position and try to shoot it down. If you shoot all of them down you win. In my opinion this game is aimed at anyone and at any age.

  -There is a random generator imported to the project. This makes the game interesting as the ship is always in a different position

  - The ships are showed on the grid as a O. If you hit it it marks the spot as X.
  - If you hit all the O in less then 50 bullets you win the game.

- Game menu.
- Nicer style 
- More difficult game modes. 

## Testing 

No errors were returned when passing through the official [PEP8 validator](https://http://pep8online.com/)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

I have deployed my website on github pages. [Github pages](https://github.com/)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, go to the Settings tab.
  - In the settings tab find github pages.
  - When your website is public, you can host your website through github pages.
