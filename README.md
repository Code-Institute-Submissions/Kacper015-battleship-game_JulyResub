# Battleship game

Battleship game is a very simple and easy game to play. You can choose a row and column such as A3 to indicate where to shoot. For every shot that hits or misses it will show up in the grid as X and -. If you shoot all of them down you win. In my opinion this game is aimed at anyone and at any age as it is very simple to understand the rules of the game. This game has a lot of developement to go through as this is only the beginning.
