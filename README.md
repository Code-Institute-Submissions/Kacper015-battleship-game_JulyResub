Battleship game is a very simple and easy game to play. You have to guess ship position and try to shoot it down. If you shoot all of them down you win. In my opinion this game is aimed at anyone

- __Results__

  - The results look really simple, if you win you can see youre sign with full color and when you lose your sign has less color so it is easier to see who win, you or the computer. 
  - There can be a winner, a loser and a draw. If there is a draw both of the signs are a bit without color.

## Testing 

My website has passed HTML and CSS Validator testing with no issues. 

My website works on different screen sizes like for e.g. phone screen. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

I have deployed my website on github pages. [Github pages](https://github.com/)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, go to the Settings tab.
  - In the settings tab find github pages.
  - When your website is public, you can host your website through github pages.
