# Battleship game

Battleship game is a very simple and easy game to play. You have to guess ship position and try to shoot it down. If you shoot all of them down you win. In my opinion this game is aimed at anyone and at any age.

### Existing Features

- __Random generator__
  
  -There is a random generator imported to the project. This makes the game interesting as the ship is always in a different position
 
- __Results__

  - The ships are showed on the grid as a O. If you hit it it marks the spot as X.
  - If you hit all the O in less then 50 bullets you win the game.

### Features Left to Implement

- Game menu.
- Nicer style 
- More difficult game modes. 

## Testing 

No errors were returned when passing through the official [PEP8 validator](https://http://pep8online.com/)

### Unfixed Bugs

One bug that I have found in my game is when you enter only a letter for example "a" the game will give you an error and you will have to run it again. This won't happen if you type in a6 twice as it will say that you have shot that space already.

## Deployment

I have deployed my website on heroku. [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)

- The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - On heroku, go to the Settings tab.
  - Add python and nodejs.
  - Connect your github with heroku. 
  - If you wish you can deploy your code autoamtically or manually.
